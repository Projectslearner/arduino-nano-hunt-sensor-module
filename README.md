# Hunt Sensor Module

#### Project Overview

The Hunt Sensor Module project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano with a hunt sensor to detect the presence of objects or obstacles. This project is particularly useful for applications requiring object detection in close proximity, such as security systems, obstacle avoidance in robotics, and automatic door opening systems.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Hunt Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram

**Block Diagram Title:** Hunt Sensor Module Connection Diagram

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Hunt Sensor Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the hunt sensor module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the hunt sensor module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the hunt sensor module to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the hunt sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the correct board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the serial monitor for messages indicating the detection of objects or obstacles.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use hunt sensor modules in security systems for intruder detection and perimeter monitoring.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Incorporate hunt sensor modules into robotic systems to detect obstacles and navigate around them.
- **Automatic Door Opening Systems:** Implement hunt sensor modules in automatic door opening systems to detect the presence of individuals approaching the door.

#### Notes

- Ensure the hunt sensor module is positioned correctly and oriented towards the area to be monitored for accurate object detection.
- Adjust the sensitivity of the hunt sensor module as needed based on the environment and application requirements.
- Implement additional logic in the code to perform specific actions based on object detection events.
